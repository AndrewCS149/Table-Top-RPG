This API serves as a handy notebook replacement for any tabletop Role-playing games, both players and GameMasters. It contains information about characters, enemies, locations and abilities and will ideally be used to track the progress of a single game, complete with an event log of everything that occurs in the game. Permissions will be set up accordingly so that each individual only has the access to view or modify information they would have in the game itself, GameMasters being omnipotent while players have much more limited access.
